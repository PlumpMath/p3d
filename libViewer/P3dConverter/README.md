This is the p3d converter for http://p3d.in.

The code utilizes FBT (File Binary Tables) from
gamekit ( http://code.google.com/p/gamekit ).

Main code for the converter is in P3dConvert, and a tester
is in P3dTester.

To cross-compile with emscripten see emccBuildIt.sh, a recent
emsdk is needed for CMake support.
